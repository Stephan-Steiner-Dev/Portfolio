    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>

    <h3>Liability for Content</h3>
    <p>
        The contents of our pages were created with the utmost care. However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy,
        completeness or timeliness of the contents. As a service provider, we are responsible under § 7 (1) DDG for our
        own content on these pages in accordance with general laws. Pursuant to §§ 8 to 10 DDG, we are not obligated to
        monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal
        activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general law remain unaffected. However,
        liability in this regard is only possible from the time of knowledge of a specific infringement. Upon
        becoming aware of such violations, we will remove this content immediately.
    </p>

    <h3>Liability for Links</h3>
    <p>
        Our website contains links to external third-party websites, the contents of which we have no influence on.
        Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of
        the
        sites is always responsible for the content of the linked sites. The linked sites were checked for possible
        legal
        violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was not recognizable at the time of linking. However, a
        permanent content control of the linked sites is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a violation. If we
        become aware of any legal infringements, we will remove such links immediately.
    </p>

    <h3>Copyright</h3>
    <p>
        The content and works created by the site operators on these pages are subject to German copyright law.
        Duplication, editing, distribution and any kind of use outside the limits of copyright law require the written
        consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this site are only permitted for private,
        non-commercial use. Insofar as the content on this site was not created by the operator, the copyrights of third
        parties are respected. In particular, third-party content is marked as such. Should you nevertheless become
        aware
        of a copyright infringement, please inform us accordingly. Upon becoming aware of violations, we will remove
        such
        content immediately.
    </p>

    <h3>Data Protection</h3>
    <p>
        The use of our website is generally possible without providing personal data. Insofar as personal data (for
        example
        name, address or e-mail addresses) is collected on our pages, this is always done on a voluntary basis as far as
        possible. This data will not be passed on to third parties without your explicit consent.
    </p>
    <p>
        We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g. communication by e-mail) may have
        security gaps. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        The use of contact data published within the framework of the legal notice obligation by third parties for the
        purpose of sending unsolicited advertising and information materials is hereby expressly prohibited. The
        operators
        of these pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of the unsolicited sending of
        advertising information, such as spam e-mails.
